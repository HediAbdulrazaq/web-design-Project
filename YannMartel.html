            <p> Yann Martel is a Canadian author known for his novel "Life of Pi," which won the Man Booker Prize in 2002. Born on June 25, 1963, in Spain, Martel grew up in various countries due to his father's diplomatic career. This exposure to diverse cultures and experiences greatly influenced his writing style.

                Martel studied philosophy at Trent University in Ontario, Canada. After graduating, he pursued a career in writing and published several novels and short stories before gaining widespread recognition with "Life of Pi." The book tells the story of a young Indian boy named Pi who survives a shipwreck and finds himself adrift in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. It explores themes of spirituality, survival, and the power of storytelling.
                
                "Life of Pi" became an international bestseller and was adapted into a successful film directed by Ang Lee in 2012. Martel's writing style is characterized by his imaginative storytelling and philosophicalÂ undertones.</p>
