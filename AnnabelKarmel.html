            <p> Annabel Jane Elizabeth Karmel (born 10 May 1957) is the author of books on nutrition and cooking for babies, children and families.

                Prior to her career in infant nutrition she was a talented musician, under the name Annabel Etkind.
                
                Her first book was The Complete Baby and Toddler Meal Planner, published in 1991. Karmel has since published 37 books on feeding babies, toddlers and families as well as eating in pregnancy and books on cooking with children.
                
                Karmel writes regularly for national newspapers and also contributes to Practical Parenting & Pregnancy, Prima Baby, BBC Good Food, Surrey, Hampshire and Tesco's Baby Club. She appears frequently on radio and television, and completed a series on the Richard & Judy Show as the Foodie Godmother, where she travelled around the country solving the problems of fussy eaters. She also filmed a 10-part series with Sky Active called Mummy That's Yummy. In 2011 Karmel aired her TV show Annabel's Kitchen, commissioned for CITV, with major sponsors being Fairy Liquid and Procter and Gamble.
                
                Karmel's iPhone app Annabel's Essential Guide to Feeding your Baby and Toddler features 120 recipes and episodes from TV series Annabel's Kitchen. Karmel also works with NUK making a range of feeding equipment for making baby food.</p>
