            <p> Jasmine Guillory is an American author known for her contemporary romance novels. Born and raised in California, Guillory developed a passion for writing at a young age. She pursued her education at Stanford University and later earned a law degree from Harvard Law School.

                While working as a lawyer, Guillory found solace and inspiration in reading romance novels, eventually deciding to try her hand at writing them. In 2018, she published her debut novel, "The Wedding Date," which quickly gained popularity and became a bestseller. The book tells the story of Alexa Monroe, a successful lawyer who agrees to accompany Drew Nichols, a charming doctor, to a wedding as his fake date. The novel explores themes of love, relationships, and the complexities of modern dating.
                
                Following the success of her debut, Guillory went on to write a series of interconnected romance novels, including "The Proposal," "The Wedding Party," "Royal Holiday," and "Party of Two." Her books often feature diverse and relatable characters navigating love and personal growth against the backdrop of contemporaryÂ society.</p>
